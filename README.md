# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The Bank Customer Churn Prediction project is focused on identifying which customers are likely to leave the bank’s services.

This app uses pre-trained machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors) to analyze customer data and estimate the probability of churn. The results are visualized with model comparisons and AI-generated explanations and recommendations.

## Input Features Explained
Credit Score: 
A numerical measure of a customer’s creditworthiness. Lower scores may indicate higher risk and higher likelihood of churn.

Country (Geography):
Indicates the customer's country (France, Germany, Spain). Geographic location may impact churn behavior due to regional policies or services.

Gender:
The customer’s gender (Male or Female). Used to analyze demographic trends in churn behavior.

Age:
Age of the customer. Younger or older customers may have varying levels of engagement with bank services.

Tenure:
Number of years the customer has stayed with the bank. Longer tenure often implies loyalty, reducing churn chances.

Account Balance:
Total balance in the customer’s account. Customers with low or zero balances may be more likely to churn.

Estimated Salary:
Annual income estimate. It helps assess financial stability and segment customers accordingly.

Number of Products:
Total financial products the customer uses (e.g., loans, credit cards). More products typically indicate stronger customer retention.

Has Credit Card:
Indicates if the customer owns a credit card issued by the bank. Credit card holders may have deeper relationships with the bank.

Is Active Member:
Whether the customer is actively engaging with bank services. Inactive customers tend to be more at risk of leaving.
